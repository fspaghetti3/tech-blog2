# tech-blog2

## Description

Tech-Blog2 (aka TekFire) is a small blogging/posting website that is hopefully going to be hosted live via Heroku in the future, however I'm currently running into many difficulties with the program, so I will have a video linked in the Usage section demonstrating the functions of TekFire.

## Installation

Under ideal use, TekFire would be utilized through a web browser, in which you can create an account, post a blog, and comment on others blogs, however this functionality is still being worked on.

## Usage

Linked here is a walkthrough video of TekFire's functions:
